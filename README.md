 Users can mint new tokens to specific addresses, assigning ownership to the recipient.
 Tokens can be transferred between owners, allowing users to trade NFTs.
 The owner of a token can approve other addresses to manage specific tokens.
  Users can approve an operator to manage all their tokens, providing flexibility in token management.
